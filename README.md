# hello-world

Hello sorry if my english is not excellent but with a translator it is better.
I go into a full professional reconvertion Having worked in commerce for 11 years my longing desire to work in the computers obsesses me.
I decided to leave my company to continue my passion and my desires.
I am looking for a training that will take me to my final goal of working in IT development. I am currently training myself as an autudidact to have some basics including html and css for the moment then I will soon pass on php.
It was only natural that I went to your school which offers intensive training of 5 months and will bring me new skills.
